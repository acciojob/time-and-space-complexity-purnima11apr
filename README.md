# Time and Space Complexity
Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. For example, if a program takes 100 seconds to run while another program completes the same task in 200 seconds, then clearly the first program has low time complexity. Therefore, as a programmer, your goal is to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizing it and making it more efficient.

**Space Complexity:** Space complexity is related to the amount of memory occupied by a program. In simple terms, any program’s space complexity is calculated by the total amount of space it occupies in the computer’s memory. So when we calculate space complexity, we take into account all the inputs of the program as well as the auxiliary space used. For example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).
